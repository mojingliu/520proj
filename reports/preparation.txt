1. We have several things in common - we both prefer Java to C, we both
 have taken several classes together, we both have similar code style.  We have 
a few differences - Brian is more interested in game design whereas Benson is
 more interested in web design and web apps.  Brian's strengths: lots of 
 experience in Java.  Benson's strengths: flexible schedule, some experience
 in Java.

2. We're going to use Sable. It seems like a better fit since we're going to use
 Java, and the fact that it was designed by a McGill alum doesn't hurt.

3. Problems - Brian is taking a heavier courseload and might be busy with other
work. 

4. For scheduling group meetings, Benson will be be on campus on the days when
he doesn't have class, and Brian will be available in between his classes.  
Meetings will be planned for these times.

5. We are planning on using pair programming to do most of the work, so this 
should keep the work fairly even.  Our roles will be identical because we will
be doing all work simultaneously. This will also make sure we both have equal
knowledge of how the different parts of the compiler work.  We will use agile 
development, which we are both familiar with from past group projects.
