We wrote a chess game using WIG and a simple calculator
(based on the example wig calculator) using cgi (in python).

Benchmark WIG: http://cs.mcgill.ca/~bshagi/cgi-bin/chess.pl?Game
Example WIG: http://cs.mcgill.ca/~bperry2/cgi-bin/calc.pl?Calculate
Python CGI version: http://cs.mcgill.ca/~bperry2/cgi-bin/pythoncalc.py

To create this Python file from a WIG compiler, we'd have to break
the WIG code down into sections that correspond with the python
sections.  The html const setup would need to be turned into
simple print "html" statments, which wouldn't be hard.

The session would just be filled in with the appropriate prints
from the Setup, and the wig code for calculations would just need
to be translated into the appropriate python.

The one difficulty would be displaying it all on one page as opposed to
across multiple pages, like in WIG.  

For part 5:
    WIG doesn't have any indexing (for strings) or even arrays, which 
makes things much more difficult than using other languages. We can't
seem to figure out a way to replicate the functionality of arrays
based on the WIG documentation.
