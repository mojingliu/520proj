For this milestone, we used the JOOS source code as reference
and then built on top of what we had for a weeder.  It's the
same style of just reducing down until the lowest levels create
a symbol and store it in the symbol table.

After finishing everything we realized we didn't handle recursion
and that we would need to go back and do multiple passes to handle
this.  

We wrote out a suite of test programs to catch every single 
possible error message.  We also compared the printed symbol
tables to a manual construction.

We made the necessary changes to our makefile and main.c to allow
for turning the printing of symbols on or off.

We did run into one snag - for something like 
	schema row{ int a; int b; int c;}

  	tuple row row1;

 and then later on:

 	row \+ (a) \+ (a, b)

We assumed this was something for the typechecker to handle.
