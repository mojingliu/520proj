These programs show some basic operations for writing graphics and text in
an applet.   Each program has the java program (.java) and an example
.html page to show how to call the applet.   

Note that JOOS does not support constants,  and so the constants from
java libraries must be used via the JoosConstants class.   See DemoFont.java
for an example.   The exact names of all Joos constants can be found
in $JOOSDIR/Lib/joos/lib/JoosConstants.java.
