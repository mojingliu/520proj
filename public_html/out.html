<title>COMP 520: Compiler Design -- Official course description</title>
<table border=5 cellspacing=5 cellpadding=5 width=100%>
<tr><td>
<h1>Compiler Design (COMP 520)</h1>

<h2>Purpose:</h2> 
This course covers modern compiler techniques and their application to both
general purpose and domain specific languages.  The practical aspects
focus on current technologies, primarily Java and interactive web services.
<p>
<h2>Contents:</h2>
A detailed syllabus is available from the course website.  This is a summary of
the core topics that will be covered:
<ul>
<li><i>Deterministic parsing:</i> LR parsers, the
<code>flex</code>/<code>bison</code> and <code>SableCC</code> tools.
<li><i>Semantic analysis:</i> abstract syntax trees, symbol tables, type checking, resource allocation.
<li><i>Virtual machines and run-time environments:</i> stacks, heaps, objects.
<li><i>Code generation:</i> resources, templates, optimizations.
<li><i>Surveys on:</i> garbage collection, native code generation, static analysis.
</ul>
<p>

<h2>Schedule:</h2>
Lectures: 3 hours/week.  Tues, Thurs, Fri 16.35-17.25, ENGTR (Trottier) 0060<br>
<p>

<h2>Prerequisites: </h2> Officially Required: COMP 273 (Introduction
to Computer Systems), COMP 302 (Programming Languages and Paradigms).
Students registering without the official prerequisites may find the
course removed from their transcript by their faculty.  This should
not be a problem for graduate students.  Speak to the instructor if
you are unsure about whether you should take the course.
<p>
Other: COMP 330 (Theoretical Aspects of Computer Science) is also
recommended.  Students without COMP 330 should familiarize themselves
with regular and context-free languages.
<p>
This is a programming-intensive course.  The primary languages used
are C and Java and familiarity with them is assumed.<p>

<h2>Evaluation</h2>
Project:        45%<br>
Assignments:    20%<br>
Midterm:        10%<br>
Final: 25%<br>
<br>
Assignment marks are allocated as follows:
<ul>
<li> 3.33% for each of the first three JOOS deliverables (10% total)
<li> 10% for the JOOS peephole optimizer
<li> 5% for the first two WIG project milestones combined
<li> 5% each for the next four project milestones (20% total)
<li> 20% for the final WIG compiler/report
</ul>

Both project and assignments are completed by groups, meaning that 65%
of the marks in this course come from group work.  The contributions of
each group member will be considered in grading.  If there is a significant
difference between the contributions of different group members, the
grades may be redistributed accordingly.
<p>

<h2>Credits:</h2>4 credits 
<p>

<h2>Text</h2>
The readings consist of chapters from the following two textbooks:
<ul>
<li>Compiler Construction, Kenneth C. Louden, 582 pages
<li>Modern Compiler Implementation in C, Andrew W. Appel, 544 pages
</ul>
plus additional readings available online.  Further, the class slides
contain essential material not found elsewhere.
See <a href="printed.html">this page</a> for details.
<p>

<h2> Detailed Course Schedule and Links: </h2>
The course web page contains a detailed course schedule, links to the
course notes and links to relevant software.  You should visit this page
often to get the most recent information.

<h2>Assignment and Exam Policy</h2>

All assignments (deliverables, milestones, and the project) are due at
midnight.  We will be using Subversion for all group submissions.
Marks will be generously deducted for lateness.  No assignment
submissions will be accepted after marked assignments have been
returned or after solutions have been discussed in class.
<p>

Both in-class exams are closed book.  If you miss either midterm you
will require a medical note or written permission from the instructor
to reschedule.

<h2> Academic Integrity at McGill University </h2>

McGill University values academic integrity. Therefore all students
must understand the meaning and consequences of cheating, plagiarism
and other academic offences under the Code of Student Conduct and
Disciplinary Procedures (see <a
href="http://www.mcgill.ca/integrity/">
http://www.mcgill.ca/integrity/</a> for more information).  A helpful
article on how to avoid plagiarism can be found at: <a
href="http://www.mcgill.ca/integrity/studentguide/">http://www.mcgill.ca/integrity/studentguide/</a>.
<p>

In terms of this course, <strong> part </strong> of your
responsibility is to ensure that you put the name of the author on all
code that is submitted.  By putting your name on the code you are
indicating that it is completely your own work.  If you use some
third-party code you must have permission to use it and you must
clearly indicate the source of the code.
<p>
In general, work submitted for this course must represent your own
efforts.  Copying assignments or tests, or allowing others to copy
your work, will not be tolerated.  Note that introducing syntactic
changes into a copied program is still considered plagiarism.
<p>
You may submit all work in either English or French.  English is
strongly preferred.
