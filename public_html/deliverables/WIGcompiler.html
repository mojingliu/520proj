<p>
You must check in the final source code for your compiler.  This
includes a Makefile or a build.xml file and a README file.  Summarize
the specific features that you can and cannot handle; you can describe
these in more detail in your project report.  Also, create a list of
benchmarks that are known to work.  You will want to use
the <a href="../howtowig.html">WIG benchmarking scripts</a> to test
your compilers on the benchmarks from this year, as well as those from
previous years and the ones in public_html/wig/examples.  The most
important thing is that you accept all of the benchmarks from 2009.
The best compilers will accept as many benchmarks as possible, and
also warn for as much potentially or actually bad code as possible.  A
built-in <code>--help</code> switch displaying compiler options is
very useful, and likewise a <code>--version</code> command is the
standard way of providing information about a program.  Also, you have
worked very hard on your compiler, so you should take some time to
come up with a nice name for it.
<p>
You do not need to hand in any hard copy of your source code as we can
simply use Subversion to access it.  However, it would be worthwhile
to make sure your source is formatted in a manner which makes it easy
to read.  This generally means running it through a tool like GNU
indent (using flags that suit your preferred indentation style), and
writing comments for non-obvious things and overall architectural
decisions.  In general, make it as easy as possible for your TA to
look at and understand your code.  Similarly, make it as easy as
possible for your TA to figure out how to compile, install, and run
WIG programs.  This is typically information that your README and
command line interface
<code>--help</code> option will provide.
<p>
This deliverable is due by midnight on Friday of Week 13.  Together
with the report it will count for 20% of your grade.  Marks will be
generously deducted for late submissions.
