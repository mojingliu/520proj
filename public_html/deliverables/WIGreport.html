<p>
You must check in a report on your WIG compiler project.
<p>
You should check in the source code plus a pdf version of your report
to <code>group-X/wig/report/</code>.  PDF is the only form acceptable
for the final copy, although you can use whichever tool you like to
create it.  There is a link below to a LaTeX template for you to look
at and adapt to your needs.  For technical illustrations,
the <a href="http://www.inkscape.org">Inkscape</a> tool is both
portable and generally excellent.  Alternatively, Graphviz and dot are
good for creating graphs from plain text specifications.  You do not
need to hand in any hard copy; your TA can print one if necessary.
<p>
<p>
Your report should describe and motivate any extensions, restrictions,
or clarifications that you have made in the WIG language
specification.  It should also describe the individual phases and
passes of your compiler, highlighting the choices that you have made.
Informal writing is acceptable, but if you want to write some or all
parts more formally that is also great.  For instance, you do not need
to provide a complete and nicely formatted type system, provided you
describe the important parts of your type checker, but you can do so
if you think that is fun.  (The 'semantic' package is good for writing
type rules.)  Finally, you must present adequate evidence that your
WIG system actually works, typically in the form of screenshots,
command line output captures, and links to installed benchmarks.  A
report should be around 30 pages and follow the outline
in <a href="../wigreport">the wig report directory</a>.  If there is
suitable content from your milestone reports, you can of course reuse
it.
<p>
A clear, well-written report with nice formatting is important.
Please feel free to email with any clarifying questions you might
have.  If your question has broader interest, send it to the mailing
list.
<p>
This deliverable is due by midnight on Friday of Week 13.  Together
with the compiler it will count for 20% of your grade.  Marks will be
generously deducted for late submissions.
