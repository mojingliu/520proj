The time, content and place of the midterm for Fall 2008 will still be
announced.
      <p>Here is a link to a sample midterm: <a href="midterm.ps">midterm.ps</a>.
Please note that this was a one and half hour midterm, whereas yours
will be only one hour. Furthermore, your midterm will be <strong>closed
book
      </strong>. However, it does give you a good idea of the
level of questions that may be asked, and also gives you some practice
questions.
