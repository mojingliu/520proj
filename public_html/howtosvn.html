      <h1>How to use Subversion</h1>
      <p>
        This is a guide detailing the use of Subversion (SVN) in COMP
        520.  It contains critical course-specific information as well
        as instructions that are more generally useful.
      </p>
      <h2>1. What is SVN?</h2> 

      Subversion is a <i>version control</i> system.  It allows users to keep track
      of changes made to any type of electronic data, which are
      typically source code, web pages or design documents.  It does
      this with the help of a <i>repository</i>, an <i>SVN server</i>,
      and an <i>SVN client</i>.
      <p>
      Reasons to use SVN:
      <p>
      <ul>

      <li><b>Concurrent development</b>: developers can work
      concurrently.  Your code cannot be overwriten silently when your
      colleague tries to add his or her code to the same file.
      Furthermore, your changes are committed atomically, which means
      that if you try to commit changes to two different files
      <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> to the repository at the same
      time as another project member, only one of you will succeed and
      you will not end up with a situation where one person commits A
      and the other commits B.  As far as this course is concerned,
      SVN stops you from having to email files around.
      <p>
 
      <li><b>Easy distribution of updates</b>: we provide you with
      access to the course website which contains all public course
      material, and all you have to do to follow along is <code>svn
      up</code> and <code>svn log</code>.  At the same time, since all
      class members share the same repository, we can also follow the
      progress of individual students and project groups.  Finally, if
      you want to work on files both at home and at school this makes
      managing them extremely easy.
      <p>

      <li><b>Version control</b>: the system creates a new revision every
      time you commit files, which means you can always roll back
      safely.  You can also request a diff of what changed in a
      particular revision, or a range of revisions.  You can also see
      a log of who changed what, as well as who changed which
      individual lines in a file.
      <p>
      
      <li><b>Other reasons</b>: See the official documention, <a
      href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/">Version Control with
      Subversion</a>.  You must read chapters 1 and 2 for this course.

      </ul>

      <h2>2. Getting Started</h2>

      In order for us to provide you with access to the class
      repository, you must send us a DSA <i>ssh public key</i>.  This
      is one half of a public/private <i>key pair</i> that you create
      and it allows for secure remote repository access without
      password authentication.  If you already have an ssh key pair
      you can skip this next step.<p>

      <pre>
      $ ssh-keygen -t dsa
      Generating public/private dsa key pair.
      Enter file in which to save the key (/home/users/chris/.ssh/id_dsa): 
      Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
      Enter same passphrase again: 
      Your identification has been saved in /home/users/chris/.ssh/id_dsa.
      Your public key has been saved in /home/users/chris/.ssh/id_dsa.pub.
      The key fingerprint is:
      ab:3c:ce:d3:61:1e:37:75:02:f9:9e:9f:ba:d9:b6:58 chris@localhost
      </pre>

      Hit enter at all of the prompts.  If you already have an ssh key
      pair and want to use a different one for this course then you
      should choose a different location to save the file.  In that
      case, you can set the environment variable <code>SVN_SSH</code>
      to <code>ssh -i /path/to/your/private/key/id_dsa</code>.  If you
      enter a password, you will get annoyed at having to authenticate
      for each repository access and will end up wanting to use the
      <code>ssh-agent</code> tool.<p>
     
      In the instructions that follow, we will use
      <code>`whoami`</code> for your CS username, which if entered on
      a school machine will actually expand to that name in place.  Of
      course, you can just type your actual username instead.<p>
      
      After you have your key pair, create a copy of your
      <i>public</i> key with your CS username in place of id_dsa:
      <p>
      
      <pre>
      $ cp .ssh/id_dsa.pub `whoami`.pub
      </pre>

      and send this file as an attachment to your TA.  They will add
      it to the <code>.ssh/authorized_keys</code> file for the course
      account and you will then have repository access.

      <h2>3. Basic Operations</h2>

      This section surveys the fundamental operations that you will
      need for day-to-day use of SVN.
      
      <h3>3.1 Check Out</h3>
      
      The first thing you should do is to check out the files from the
      remote class repository to your local <i>working copy</i>:
      <p>

      <pre> 
      $ mkdir cs520
      $ cd cs520
      $ svn co svn+ssh://cs520@svn.cs.mcgill.ca/2012/students/`whoami` `whoami`
      </pre>

      This creates a directory `whoami` which is identical to your CS
      username as a subdirectory of <code>cs520</code>.  It is your
      personal student repository, and you will use it to check in all
      of your individual assignments.  You can rename it to whatever
      you like, Subversion does not care.  Next, you should check out
      the course website:
      <p>

      <pre>
      $ svn co svn+ssh://cs520@svn.cs.mcgill.ca/2012/public_html public_html
      </pre>

      This directory contains all of the course information and all of
      the source code and binaries that you need.  Again, you can
      rename it to whatever you like.  Finally, after we assign group
      numbers then you will have access to a folder shared between all
      members of your group.  With your group number in place of X:
      <p>

      <pre>
      $ svn co svn+ssh://cs520@svn.cs.mcgill.ca/2012/groups/group-X group-X
      </pre>

      will create that group directory for you.  You will use this to
      check in all group assignments and your course project.
      <p>
                  
      After checking out, you can add, modify or delete files in the
      local working copy, and nothing will be changed in the
      repository or visible to anybody else until you <i>commit</i> or
      <i>check in</i>.

      <h3>3.2 Update</h3>
      
      Every time you start working, it is a good idea to make sure
      your local working copies contain the latest version.  This
      requires the <code>svn update</code> or <code>svn up</code>
      command:
      <p>
      
      <pre>
      $ cd cs520
      $ cd `whoami`
      $ svn up
      $ cd ../public_html
      $ svn up
      $ cd ../group-X
      $ svn up
      </pre>

      Of course, you can also just do:
      <p>

      <pre>
      $ cd cs520
      $ svn up `whoami` public_html group-X
      </pre>

      This command recursively updates all files and sub-directories
      in all working copies.  If you encounter a conflict as indicated
      by <code>C</code>, you should refer to the Subversion
      documentation for details on how to resolve it.
      
      <h3>3.3 Diff</h3>

      After you update and begin modifying files, you will often want to
      check the difference between your version and the repository
      version:
      <p>

      <pre>
      $ svn diff
      </pre>

      This provides a <i>unified diff</i> between your version and the
      latest repository version on stdout, using exactly the same
      format as <code>diff -u</code>.  You can also use <code>svn
      diff</code> to look at the changes between two specific
      revisions.  For instance:
      <p>

      <pre>
      $ svn diff -r2:3
      </pre>
      
      will show you what changed in the repository between revisions 2
      and 3.  Finally, although <code>svn diff</code> operates on the
      current directory <code>.</code> by default, you can also
      specify a particular file, directory, or some local or remote
      URI.
      <p>
      <b>It is a very good idea to run <code>svn diff</code> before
      committing your changes.</b>

      <h3>3.4 Commit</h3>

      Once finished your local work, your changes will not appear in
      the repository until you <i>commit</i> them or <i>check them in</i>:
      <p>

      <pre>      
      $ svn ci
      </pre>

      Here, <code>svn ci</code> is an alias for <code>svn
      commit</code>.  The <code>svn</code> binary will attempt to open
      an editor for you to leave a log message, and you can control
      which editor is opened through use of the EDITOR environment
      variable.  For example, on my system:
      <p>

      <pre>
      export EDITOR='emacs -nw'
      </pre>

      means that <code>svn</code> will open the command line interface
      to Emacs in the current terminal.  <b>You should always leave a
      meaningful log message.</b>  For example, if we were to check in
      changes to the current document at this very moment we might
      write:
      <p>

      <pre>
      * Expand on SVN instructions.
      --This line, and those below, will be ignored--

      M    howtosvn.html
      </pre>

      For each individual thing that changed in your commit, create a
      new bullet point preceded by "<code>* </code>".  This makes it
      much easier for you, your collaborators, and your instructor and
      TA to follow along.  If you do not save the file,
      <code>svn</code> will prompt you to <code>a)bort, c)ontinue,
      e)dit</code>.  This lets you back out of a commit if you realize
      you are missing something.  As an alternative to editing a file,
      you can also specify a log message on the command line:
      <p>

      <pre>
      $ svn ci -m "* Expand on SVN instructions."
      </pre>

      However, given that opening an editor is both fast and much
      safer in that it provides you with a list of modifications to
      review, it is best to leave this option for non-interactive
      scripted use.
      <p>
      
      If you want to check in individual files or directories rather
      than the current working copy and all files and directories it
      contains, simply pass them to <code>svn ci</code>.
      <p>

      <h3>3.5 Add</h3>

      The following command:<p>

      <pre>      
      $ svn add &lt;file&gt;
      </pre>

      adds new files or directories to your working copy.  They
      will not appear in the repository until you run <code>svn
      ci</code>.  Note that you can disable the recursion when adding
      directories with the <code>-N</code> flag.
      
      <h3>3.6. Copy/Move/Delete</h3>      

      These three commands work similarly to the Unix commands
      <code>cp</code>, <code>mv</code>, and <code>rm</code>.

      <h4>3.6.1 svn cp</h4>

      <pre>
      $ svn cp &lt;src&gt; &lt;dest&gt;
      </pre>

      <code>svn cp</code> will also add the destination file or
      directory to the working copy.  The advantage of this command is
      that it maintains version history from before the copy, and that
      it requires almost no extra storage space in the repository.
      For example, assume there is a directory called
      <code>joos/a-</code> that is a subdirectory of the
      <code>public_html</code> directory for this course that contains
      some source code you wish to modify for an assignment, and that
      the instructor has asked you to place your modified source code in
      <code>group-X/joos/scanparse</code>.  In that case, you need
      simply enter:
      <p>

      <pre>
      $ mkdir group-X/joos                                # make sure parent dir exists
      $ svn add group-X/joos                              # add empty parent directory
      $ svn ci group-X/                                   # commit empty parent directory
      $ svn cp public_html/joos/a- group-X/joos/scanparse # create copy of source code
      $ svn ci                                            # check in copy of source code
      </pre>

      In fact, <code>svn cp</code> is really the mechanism for creating
      <i>branches</i> with SVN.
      <p>

      If we want to see what you have changed, we need simply ask
      <code>svn diff</code> for all changes between your initial
      <code>svn cp</code> command and your current state.
      
      <h4>3.6.2 svn mv</h4>

      <pre>
      $ svn mv &lt;src&gt; &lt;dest&gt;
      </pre>

      <code>svn mv</code> can either be used to rename files and
      directories, or to move files or directories to different
      directories while keeping the same name.  In doing so, it
      maintains version history.
      <p>

      <h4>3.6.3 svn rm</h4>

      <pre>
      $ svn rm &lt;file&gt;
      </pre>

      <code>svn rm</code> deletes the file or directory from the working copy, as
      you might expect.
      <p>

      <i>Important</i>: Like <code>svn add</code>, these three
      commands just tell SVN that you <i>want</i> to copy/move/delete
      files, and you have to run <code>svn ci</code> afterwards to
      commit your change.  <b>It is a good habit to commit
      immediately after you add/copy/move/delete files.</b>
      
      <h3>3.7 Retrieve Log</h3>
      
      If you want to look at the repository history, Subversion
      provides a detailed log upon request:
      <p>

      <pre>
      $ svn log | less
      </pre>
      
      If you want to see full paths that are changed, pass the
      <code>-v</code> option:
      <p>

      <pre>
      $ svn log -v | less
      </pre>

      You can also specify individual files if you are not interested in
      the entire log for the current directory.

      <h2>4. Less frequently used commands</h2>

      Of course, there are actually many other commands, several of
      which are quite useful, including <code>svn status</code>,
      <code>svn revert</code>, <code>svn cleanup</code>, <code>svn
      merge</code>, and <code>svn resolved</code>.  When things go
      wrong, and they will go wrong, these commands are there to help
      you out.  In fact, there is actually a built-in command to teach
      you about them:
      
      <pre>
      $ svn help
      usage: svn &lt;subcommand&gt; [options] [args]
      Subversion command-line client, version 1.4.3.
      Type 'svn help &lt;subcommand&gt;' for help on a specific subcommand.
      Type 'svn --version' to see the program version and RA modules
        or 'svn --version --quiet' to see just the version number.
      
      Most subcommands take file and/or directory arguments, recursing
      on the directories.  If no arguments are supplied to such a
      command, it recurses on the current directory (inclusive) by default.
      
      Available subcommands:
         add
         blame (praise, annotate, ann)
         cat
         checkout (co)
         cleanup
         commit (ci)
         copy (cp)
         delete (del, remove, rm)
         diff (di)
         export
         help (?, h)
         import
         info
         list (ls)
         lock
         log
         merge
         mkdir
         move (mv, rename, ren)
         propdel (pdel, pd)
         propedit (pedit, pe)
         propget (pget, pg)
         proplist (plist, pl)
         propset (pset, ps)
         resolved
         revert
         status (stat, st)
         switch (sw)
         unlock
         update (up)

      Subversion is a tool for version control.

      <b>If anything is confusing, then again, the Subversion documention
      is excellent.</b>  We are also happy to help you if you send us
      a precise and accurate description of your problem or if you
      come and see us during our office hours.

      <h2>5. Recommend Editing Cycle</h2>

      Although you are free to use SVN as you wish, this is an editing
      cycle that works very well:

      <pre>
      svn up           # update
      svn log | less   # see details of update if there was one
      while (change not implemented correctly)
        while (program does not compile)
          edit files   # implement change
          make         # try compiling
        make check     # run automatic tests
      svn diff         # review changes
      svn ci           # commit      
      </pre>

      For source code, the time between commits should be small.
      Ideally, each commit makes an incremental and self-contained
      improvement.  If you avoid checking in things that do not work,
      you will save yourself and others headaches in the future.
      <p>
      Of course, you may run into conflicts and other problems, in
      which case you should refer to the excellent Subversion
      documentation.

      <h2>6. Other Advice</h2>

      <ul>
      <li> Do not check in generated source code or binaries.
      <li> Do not worry about repository disk space: copies are cheap
      and commits are incremental so you should use <code>svn
      cp</code> and <code>svn ci</code> liberally.
      <li> If you check something in, you must run <code>svn up</code>
      before that change becomes visible to <code>svn log</code> and
      other operations that examine history.
      <li> If the prospect of your working copy being deleted scares
      you, it is probably time to commit.
      </ul>

      <h2>7. SVN GUI Clients</h2> 

      If you are not used to Unix and the command line interface, life
      may be easier if you have a GUI client and do not need to type
      commands in a console.  However, at the same time, this course
      is an excellent opportunity to improve on your command line
      abilities, a skill that will serve you well for years to come.
      <p>
      
      Under Windows, you can try <a
      href="http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/">TortoiseSVN</a>, an SVN
      client that integrates commands into your right-click context
      menu.  It is fairly easy to install and use.
      <p>
      
      For Linux, there is <a
      href="http://zoneit.free.fr/esvn/index.php">eSVN</a>, although it is
      apparently not as stable as TortoiseSVN.
      <p>
      
      A cross-platform solutions is <a
      href="http://subclipse.tigris.org/">SubClipse</a>, an Eclipse
      plugin that does the same job.  You can find very clear
      instructions on how to install this plugin here: <a
      href="http://subclipse.tigris.org/install.html">http://subclipse.tigris.org/install.html</a>.
      <p>

      <i>SubClipse tip</i>: Using "Synchronize with repository" rather
      than "Update" will show you more detail when you want to update
      your local working copy.
      <p>
      Finally, if you are looking to use SVN in your own projects, you
      may be interested in <a
      href="http://trac.edgewall.org/">Trac</a>, an integrated
      bug tracking, wiki, and version control system.
