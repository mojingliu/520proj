      </p>
      <h3>Deliverables</h3>
      <p>A <i>deliverable</i> is a complete assignment that you are
required to submit for grading. The WIG deliverables that are due in
weeks 3,4 and weeks 6-9 are, in combination, worth 25% of your final
grade. The JOOS deliverables are worth 20% of your final grade.<br>
      </p>

and project preparation</a><br>
        </li>

      </ul>
The final WIG compiler and report submitted in Week 13 will be worth
another 20% of your final grade (both in combination):
      <ul>
        <li>Week 13: <a href="deliverables/WIGcompiler.html">WIG:
compiler</a> and <a href="deliverables/WIGreport.html">WIG: report</a>
(both compiler and report together are worth 20% of the final grade)</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
      </ul>
<!--       <h3>Late days</h3> -->
<!-- Each <span style="font-style: italic;">group</span> will be given <span -->
<!--  style="font-style: italic;">three late days</span> for the entore -->
<!-- term. If you want to take a late day at the given deadline then simply -->
<!-- email the TA before this deadline, stating the group number and the -->
<!-- number of late days you wish to take. You have three late days in total -->
<!-- for the entire term and you may distribute them in whatever way you -->
<!-- like. As long as your group uses these three late days or less this -->
<!-- will not impact your grade. If you submit late without declaring that -->
<!-- you wish to take late days upfront or after having run out of late days -->
<!-- then the TA will consider this a late submission and will take this -->
<!-- into account when grading the submitted deliverable. You <span -->
<!--  style="font-style: italic;">cannot</span> take late days for the -->
<!-- submission of the peephole patterns (week 12) and the final WIG -->
<!-- compiler and report in Week 13.<br> -->
      <h3>Exercises<br>
      </h3>
      <p>We will also give out <i>exercises</i> every week. These
exercises are voluntary and are meant to give you an opportunity to
prepare for the midterm and final exam. You will not be required to
hand in those exercises and we will not grade them, however if you
follow the exercises every week you should feel little to no need for
additional preparation for the exams. We will often discuss the
exercises in
class.<br>
