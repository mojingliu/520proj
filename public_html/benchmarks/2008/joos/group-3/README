Benchmark Joos - 
McMap oF McGill EngiNeering Complex 


Due Date: 3 Oct, 2008
Author: Xiaoxi Dong, Toheed Aslam

Project Description:
 For this milestone, we implement an Direction for McGill Engineering complex. We have a map for mcgill engineering department, which include the buildings and roads. When user input a starting point and his/her desitination, our benchmark will give the user directions on how they reach the destination. Plus, if it is later than 6pm and earlier than 7am, you will need a valid McGill ID card to access these buildings! Time is taken from System!

Features involved in benchmarks:
Inheritance and Polymorphism,
override constructors
recursion
avoid the expressions and statements which are not supported in Joos
and etc.


mBuildingNode.java  - Inherits Node class. Represent a building.
mCrossNode.java  - Inherits Node class. Represent a cross of road, or a cross of road and building entrance.
mNode.java - Superclass of mCrossNode and mBuildingNode. Has basic informaion of a location, such as name, coordinates and identify 

McMap.java - main class, read from map, computes distances and shortest path and print

map - map of McGill

Note, the information of buildings are not preciese, we make up the numbers according to personal expierence of years of wandering.
