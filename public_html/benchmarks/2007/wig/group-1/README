WIG Benchmark

Create a on-line appointment reservation system. We used tuples to
record login information, so you have to login to make an
appointment. If you fail three times when login, you are rejected by
the system. In addition, we use tuple to record the appointment
information and echo back to user.

Wig does not accept password type input box, so I have to use
javascript to create one on-the-fly; however, if I do not have a input
box named "password", I can not receive "password", so I have to
create a input text and use javascript to hide and rename it so that
my password type input can have the name "password".

We have a password type input box, which echo '*' when you input your
password.
