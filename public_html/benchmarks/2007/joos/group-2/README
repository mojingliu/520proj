Joos Deliverable: Benchmark

Group 2: Diana Gheorghiu and Gina Jeong

An OBST is an optimal binary search tree. It is designed to take advantage of 
advanced knowledge of the distribution of searches over the binary tree in 
order to determine the best way to arrange the nodes. 

The program reads in formated text indicating the number of entries, the 
percentage chance of searching for each node, the percentage chance of
searching for it and missing it, as well as the node itself (as a string).
It then calculates the cost of finding the best tree, and outputs the tree in 
a descriptive form.

The problem is sloved by dynamic programming so a (possibly) large matrix is 
used to hold values. To accomodate the move to JOOS, matrix had to be 
transformed to use only Vectors, the program was changed to accept only 
Integers and other small changes were added to make the program more 
interesting.

The file OBST.java contains the source code for the program.
The file in1 contains the sample input for the program.
The file out1 contains the sample output for the program.
