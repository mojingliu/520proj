This sounds like a really stupid idea. It is a really stupid idea. Or is it?

There are many ways in which it makes a superb benchmark. But first, the spec:


   INPUT: a newline-separated list of words

   OUTPUT: a text file printed in bursts such that when viewed in an
           ordinary-sized UNIX terminal, it's a full-blown ASCII animation
           The road signs display the words from the input

This program is far more powerful than the current demo reveals.
   
   There is an underlying nearly-continuos coordinate system
   (since JOOS has no floats, we have a few thousand ints per inch)

   Views are computed with a camera position and zoom level.

   The camera can follow an object (here, it follows the car)

   The world is a set of SpatialObjects, each of which changes however the hell
   it wants over time, (e.g. usually its position and/or appearance change)

   We built a general-purpose ASCII-art animation framework
   (offering fillCanvas(char), randomizeCanvas(), drawSprite(), printFrame())

   We were going to add a lot more SpatialObjects, use inheritance more (each
   car has a Wheel, be it a Tire or SnowTire or BlingBedeckedTire), have a
   beautiful winding road, have a Steering object handle obstacle avoidance,
   and much more. Hopefully we'll be able to revise this before bechmark time.
