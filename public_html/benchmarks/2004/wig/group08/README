WIG service:
===============
We have written and tested a mailing list WIG service. In this service,
users can join the group (mailing-list), or see who the group members are.
It consists of three pages:
1- Welcome page: It shows a counter of how many users visited the page so
far. It also asks the user to select one of the following actions: "Join
Us", "Show Members, or "Quit Now".
2- Join Us page: In this page the user fills in their information (name,
phone, and email). At least one field must be filled    in in order to be
able to submit the form.
3- Show Members page: In this page a list of all members is shown.

>From each page you can easily navigate to the other two pages.

We have tried to implement the service with having an array of tuples but
got an error message about Schema not being implemented. So we switched to
having just strings.

We compiled it with bsdwig4.
