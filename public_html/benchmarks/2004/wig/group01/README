For this milestone we wrote a little bit of online pets store as CGI and WIG.

For CGI part we implemented three plain html pages,
one perl script (checkinv.pl) and one c program (verify.c)

The start page is catalogue.html that will ask user about pets he wants to buy.
After pets are selected, user clicks "Add to Basket" button that sends
a request to cgi-bin/checkinv.pl

This script will open text file in data/inventory.txt and verify that items
selected are in stock, update inventory.txt, and generate an invoice.

The page login.html prompts user for a login name and password and sends them
to cgi-bin/verify.cgi (compiled verify.c)
verify.cgi checks data/users.txt for valid login/password pair and if found
redirects user to management.html, otherwise displays an error message.

Notes:
1. To execute perl script you have do chmod 711 checkinv.pl
2. At login.html try login: sparky; password: test
3. Running version at: http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~dprykh/cs520/CGI/
4. If you ask for more pets then there are in stock, the program
   will sell you all it has.


For WIG part we implemented something similar. We have three sessions:
1) Init - initializes the stock with pets
2) Shop - lets you buy the pets
3) Add - allows you to add pets into stock

Notes:
1. We used wig4 to compile our service
2. Running version at: http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~dprykh/cgi-bin/shop4.cgi?Shop
