Group 05
James Li and Denis Dube

This group did two WIG benchmarks.

1) a personal TODO listing. It works fairly well, except that lack of
SQL database and/or file support really limits what I can do to say 1
user/password and 6 messages. I compiled it with WIG18.

** It only works with username/password of guest/guest **
