After reviewing the WIG benchmarks for previous years we decided to
implement a simple game of Blackjack for our WIG service. We think
it's pretty cool.

wig10 won't compile our wig service properly, because string literals
compile double-double quoted. Example:

WIG: return "A";
C: return ""A"";

wig4 doesn't show the "continue" button on a "show" statement, and
wig18 can't deal with comments, so we stuck with pwig. It should be
noted however that pwig segfaults instead of printing an error when it
encounters invalid return statements. Again, nothing but wig10 worked
on the bsd machines, so we compiled on mimi and installed on freebsd.
