==WIG SERVICE==
Our WIG Service is a game of Tic Tac Toe where a player can only play against
the computer (which is very naive).
http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~bcheun1/cgi-bin/TicTacToeT4.cgi?Move

The CGI script corresponding to our WIG Service would most likely have the
following pseudo code structure:

board[9];

// run on every request
recievemove(player_move) {
  board[player_move] = "X";
  checkdone(board);
  computermove(board);
  checkdone(board);
  showboard();
}

showboard() {
  print(board);
  print(input player_move);
}
