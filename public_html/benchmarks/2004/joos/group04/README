Benchmark
---------
Our benchmark program applies different image filters to an input
image from stdin and outputs the resulting image to stdout.



How to run
----------
java FilterDemo < in1 > output



Files
-----

FilterDemo.java is the actual benchmark.
Filter.java contains the implementation of the filters.
FilterDemoExterns.joos contains the declarations for our external classes.

The directory imagelib contains the few small external java classes that we
had to implement:
JoosImageIO.java 
JoosSystem2.java 
BufferedImageConsts.java

in1 is an input image file and out1 is the matching expected output
file.
