This program implements the knights tour algorithm. As it is a very
slow algorithm, it only ever finishes for inputs of 1-6 and sometimes
8 if enough memory is available.

Some sample input is in a file called in1 and the corresponding output
is in a file called out1.

To compile use jjoosc KnigthsTour.java FindTour.java Vertex.java
BitMap.java TwoDVector.java.

To run say java KnightsTour < in1 > out1.

Alternatively to run say java KnightsTour and you will be prompted for
an input.
