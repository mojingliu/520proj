For more details on the actual benchmarks, please look at the source
code in Main.java

To compile with JAVAC, try: sh javacCompile.sh
To compile with JOOSC, try: sh jooscComiple.sh


Note: both these scripts depend on the enviornment and path variables
explained on the 520 homepage. They will also delete all .class and .j
files in the directory they are executed in.




To run the benchmark do:
java Main < in1 > out1  

Where inputSize.txt is a text file with:
Line 1: integer   <-- Size of the vector that will be filled with random #'s
Line 2: integer   <-- Size of the queue (and the vector that will test it)
