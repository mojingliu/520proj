COMP 520, GROUP no. 6, Fall 2004 - BENCHMARK program

Description:

  The VSMore (Very Simple Matching Of Regular Expressions) program
  implements a very simple regular expression matching mechanism. It
  receives two strings (each one on a separate line of input).  The first
  one is regular expression to match, the second is string that is to be
  matched against provided regular expression.
  
  String being mathed string may only contain the following charcters:
  
  a-z A-Z 0-9.
  
  The regular expression consists from the same set of characters as string
  being matched with addition of several special characters, that is:
  
  + - one or more occurences of the entity on the left of this character,
  * - any number of occurrences,
  ? - one or zero occurrences,
  [ ] - a set of characters to match, may be combined with the three above.
  
Examples:
  
  bca*
  bcaaaaaaaa
  
  a+b
  ab
  
  ab?c
  ac
  
  a[bcdefghij]k
  ack
  
  Z+z[xyz]?
  ZZZZzzzzzzz
  
  [101dalmat][456milions]+3li?k*[123tea]*
  14m3l1t3
  
Notes:
  
  The implemented algorithm is greedy, that is, at any point of it tries to
  match as many characters as possible, even if later it gives different
  results than user could expect.  This is best illustrated on a small
  example.  The following pair will not match:
  
  a*a
  aa
