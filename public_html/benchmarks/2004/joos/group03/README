JOOS Deliverable : benchmark program
Group 03
---------------------------------------------- 

The program implements a web link harvester.

Starting from the given web address, the harvester looks for the links
on the page and follows them.  It continue searching to the depth
given as the program argument. The search may be restricted to the
site or the domain.

As the result, the program prints out the search trace specifying the
found links with the depth level to which they belong. It also gives
the reason of the link skipping (not following further), e.g. as in
the case when the maximum depth is reached.
