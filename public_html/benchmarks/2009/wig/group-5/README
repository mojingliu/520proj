Fat Checker README file (fatchecker.wig)
========================================
Fat checker allows you to calculate your body mass index (BMI) in an 
instant. Once you've entered your weight in kilograms, and your height 
in centimeters, fat checker redirects you to the Result page. Fat 
checker additionally tells you the BMI category you fall into. Moreover, 
fat checker will give you a sample diagnosis for your constitution 
completely free-of-charge. When you're done reading the results, you can 
continue to the next page and you'll see the fattest BMI encountered so 
far.

Check out wikipedia for more information on the BMI:
