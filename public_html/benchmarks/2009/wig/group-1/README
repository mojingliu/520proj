WIG Milestone
Group 1

A simple link posting/ranking service (similar to Digg or Reddit) that keeps track of 5 links and their score.  When a new link is added, it replaces the current lowest ranked link.  If there are multiple links with the same score, the first link encountered will be replaced.

There is no error checking of subbmitted links so please play nice.
