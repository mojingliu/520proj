      <h1>Philosophy of the course</h1>
This course was originally designed by <a
 href="http://www.sable.mcgill.ca/%7Ehendren/">Laurie Hendren</a>
and <a href="http://www.brics.dk/%7Emis">Michael I. Schwartzbach</a>.
It is offered at the University of Aarhus and
at <a href="http://www-acaps.cs.mcgill.ca/%7Ehendren/520/">McGill
University</a>,
as well as several other universities where the course has been
adopted. Laurie taught it at McGill until 2004, except for <a
 href="http://www.sable.mcgill.ca/%7Efqian/">Feng Qian</a> teaching it
in 2003, and since then <a
 href="http://www.sable.mcgill.ca/%7Ennaeem/nomair.html">Nomair Naeem</a>
(2005), <a href="http://www.sable.mcgill.ca/%7Eclump/">Clark Verbrugge</a>
(2006), <a href="http://www.sable.mcgill.ca/%7Ecpicke/">Chris Pickett</a>
(2007) and <a href="http://www.bodden.de/">Eric Bodden</a> (2008) have
taught it.
      <p>This is primarily a standard senior undergraduate compiling
course, but with a
twist in its structure and choice of projects. </p>
      <p>There are mainly two points that we seek to emphasize: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>compiler technology is useful for applications other than
full-scale programming languages; and </li>
        <li>learning by example is very effective. </li>
      </ul>
The first point dictates the choice of two distinct projects. One
project
involves a largish subset of Java, called JOOS, which is compiled
into Java bytecode for execution by a Java virtual machine. <span
 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The other project involves a
domain-specific language, called WIG,
which compiles high-level specifications of interactive web services
into C-based CGI-scripts (or potentially code for other targets if
students desire).</span>
      <p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The second point is exploited by
providing the students with
the <a href="a-source.html">source code</a> for an almost complete
implementation of the JOOS compiler. This code is studied,
extended, and used as a template for the WIG compiler
(and hopefully for future compilers and front-ends). </p>
      <p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">As an added benefit, the
two projects combine to provide the students
with a detailed and sophisticated knowledge of both client-side
and server-side web programming. </p>
