<h1>The <img src="images/joos32.gif"> source code, <img src="images/a-small.gif"> version, SableCC/Java</h1>

A version of the JOOS compiler that uses SableCC 2 and Java was
created in time for the Fall 2000 version of this course.  It was
written as a 308-400 (now COMP-400) course project by Othman Alaoui.
This compiler was later updated in time for the Fall 2004 course to
use SableCC 3.

<p>
You may be able to learn from these two versions of the JJOOS compiler
and to use some of the ideas for your own WIG compiler.  The complete
compilers are available here:<p>
<ul>
<li>JJOOS for SableCC 2: <a
href="joos/jjoos-scc-2/">browse source</a>
<li>JJOOS for SableCC 3: <a
href="joos/jjoos-scc-3/">browse source</a>
</ul>
<p>
and also available in the <code>public_html/joos/jjoos-scc-*</code>
directories of the class SVN repository.

<p>
You can also read Othman's final report to understand some of his design
decisions. For those of you using SableCC 2, you can read how he uses
"hidden productions" to clean up the CST a bit and to make subsequent
passes a bit easier.<p>
