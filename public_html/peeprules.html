<h1>Peephole contest: rules and prizes</h1>

Part of the A+ JOOS project involves the design and implementation of
peephole patterns that operate on an intermediate representation of
Java bytecode.  Each project group submits a collection of peephole
patterns that attempts to minimize the number of bytes required by
JOOS methods, and these collections then compete against each other.

The rules are as follows:
<ul>
<li>Each project group may submit only one entry.
<p>
<li>An entry is a collection of peephole patterns as defined by the
<a href="deliverables/JOOSpeep.html">requirements</a> of the A+ project.
<p>
<li>All <i>unsound</i> patterns are deleted from the collection.
<p>
<li>A pattern is judged to be unsound by the teaching assistant. A
project group may appeal this judgment.
<p>
<li>Each entry will be tested on the entire collection of benchmark
programs generated by the project groups.
<p>
<li>The patterns will be run in the context of the standard A+ compiler.
<p>
<li>The winner is the entry that minimizes the combined code size
(number of bytes) of methods in the class benchmark programs as measured by
the <code>totalbytes</code> script (to be provided).
<p>
<li>Finally, entries are only accepted until the beginning of week 12
at McGill.
</ul>
<p>
The prizes for this year are to be determined.  In the past, prizes were
<i>Official dOvs Peephole Contest Winners' T-Shirts</i>, one for each
member of the winning project group, and the T-shirts were presented to
the winners at the end of the course.
