You must implement the language WIG, which is an acronym for
<i>Web Interface Generator</i>.  <h3>The WIG Language</h3> WIG is a
proper subset of <a href="http://www.brics.dk/bigwig/index.html">
<font face=courier>&lt;bigwig&gt;</font></a> restricted to a specific
<a href="wiggrammar.txt">grammar</a>.  We also provide you with <a
href="wiggrammar_bison.txt">bison</a> and <a
href="wiggrammar_sablecc.txt">sablecc</a> versions with all conflicts
resolved.  An introduction to the WIG language and its intended uses
is contained in the <a href="slides/wig.pdf">slides for lectures on
WIG</a>. WIG does not have a detailed language definition; it is part
of your project to determine the precise semantics for your own
version of the language.  Most of WIG looks just like the language C;
the primary issues to discuss are html constants, tuples, and the
constructs <font face=courier>plug</font> and <font
face=courier>show</font>.

<h3>Requirements</h3>
You must work in groups of sizes two or three.
<p>
There is a strict deadline for the project:
the <a href="deliverables/WIGcompiler.html">compiler</a> and the
<a href="deliverables/WIGreport.html">report</a> in week 14.
<p>
Your compiler <i>must</i> work, at least for a subset of WIG.  A
compiler that won't generate working code for even the smallest
examples will not be accepted.  Apart from that, your implementation
will be evaluated on structure, correctness, and elegance of both your
compiler and the generated CGI-scripts.
<p>
The report must document all the choices that you have made during the
project.  Your report can be informally written (i.e. it does not
need to read like a technical manual) and may assume familiarity with
the WIG project.  A longer report is not necessarily a better one, but
don't exclude anything of interest.

<h3>Restrictions or extensions</h3>

If you feel the WIG project is too large, then make simplifying
restrictions rather than give up. For example, if you throw out
functions or tuples, then you are left with a smaller but still
coherent language. It is important that you clearly state what
restrictions you have made; your potential maximal grade will of
course go down, but you will not be severely penalized.  It is still
possible to get an A for a WIG compiler that does not implement
tuples. However, such a compiler must be complete and correct in all
other aspects.
<p>
If you feel the WIG project is too small, then it would be a good idea
to extend it with some features. However, you <i>must</i> follow these
rules:
<ul>
<li>you must first have an implementation of standard WIG;
<li>your language must be a strict superset of standard WIG; and
<li>your extensions must be motivated and documented.
</ul>

Ideas for extensions are obviously available from the <a
href="http://www.brics.dk/bigwig/index.html"><font
face=courier>&lt;bigwig&gt;</font></a> language.  Your potential
maximal grade will of course go up, but you should mainly do this to
challenge yourself.
