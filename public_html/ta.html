<p>
You should take advantage of the TAs' office hours.  Since there are
so many hours where one of them is expecting to be in the lab, they
are not required to sit at their desk and wait for you, so you should
check beforehand that one of them is there if you really need to see
someone.  Our lab's phone number is 514-398-7071 ext. 00076.
