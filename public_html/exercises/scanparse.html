<h1>Week 2</h1>
<h1>Exercises on scanners and parsers</h1>

<ol>

<li>Implement 3 different <font face=courier><code>flex</code></font>-based scanners that:<p>
    <ol>
    <li>Format text in 80-column blocks while removing multiple blanks,
        leading blanks, and trailing blanks.
    <li>Remove all tags from an HTML document.
    <li>Introduce plausible spelling errors.
    </ol>
<p>
Provide a Makefile that includes a "check" target for testing the
scanners that works with sample input and output files that you also
provide.
<p>

<li>What do the following regular expressions match?<p>
    <ol>
    <li><font face=courier><code>\"([^\"])*\"</code></font>
    <li><font face=courier><code>http:[^?]*?</code></font>
    <li><font face=courier><code>[-+]?[0-9]*\.[0-9]+([eE][-+]?[0-9]+)?</code></font>
    </ol>
<p>

<li>A question from a previous year said, "Read the <font
face=courier><code>flex</code></font> documentation and discuss
the full syntax for regular expressions."  Since you could simply echo
back the manual to answer that, instead explain what
the following regular expressions do:<p>

<ol>
<li><font face=courier><code>(^|[ \t\r\n])((ftp|http|https|gopher|mailto|news|nntp|telnet|wais|file|prospero|aim|webcal):(([A-Za-z0-9$_.+!*(),;/?:@&~=-])|%[A-Fa-f0-9]{2}){2,}(#([a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9$_.+!*(),;/?:@&~=%-]*))?([A-Za-z0-9$_+!*();/?:~-]))</code></font>
<li><font face=courier><code>(^|[ \t\r\n<;(])((([A-Za-z0-9$_.+%=-])|%[A-Fa-f0-9]{2})+@(([A-Za-z0-9$_.+!*,;/?:%&=-])|%[A-Fa-f0-9]{2})+\.[a-zA-Z0-9]{1,4})</code></font>
</ol>
<p>

That is, identify what you think they are attempting to match, provide
an English description of each component of the regular expression,
and talk about any problems with respect to RFC specifications if you
can spot or know about them.

<li>Invent a grammar for a small language that is amusing in some
way.  Amusing is defined as being able to make your instructor laugh.
Provide the following:<p>
<ol>
<li>A BNF grammar
<li>An EBNF grammar for the same thing
<li>Railroad syntax diagrams
<li>An English description of the language and grammar.
</ol><p>
You should draw the syntax diagrams using rail.sty or some other
automated tool.  You won't fail the exercise if you draw them by hand, but since
you'll need an automated tool later in the course you should really
just learn how to do it now.  If you want to see how they were typeset for your
slides, look at the <a href="../slides/">slides directory</a>, in particular <a
href="../slides/scanparse.tex">scanparse.tex</a> and <a
href="../slides/build_scanparse.sh">build_scanparse.sh<a>.
Cookies if you can write a working Makefile.

</ol>
