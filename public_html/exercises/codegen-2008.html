          <li>Derive code templates for a do-while loop and a for-loop,
similar to the template for while-loops, which was presented in class. <a href="codegen/codegen-solution.pdf">solution</a></li>
          <li>Under which circumstances can a program store a value
different from <tt>this</tt> in local variable 0? Could a peephole
optimization
determine such circumstances? <b>Answer: Variable 0 can hold other values (a) if
the surrounding method is a static method (<tt>this</tt> is not accessible) or if <tt>this</tt> is
never accessed in the current method. This property requires a live-variable analysis and
cannot be decided in a peephole optimizer.</b> </li>
          <li>Assume a (static) method that stores the values x,y, and
z in local variables 0,1 and 2. Write down the code that the "naive"
code generation scheme would generate for the expression x==y || x==z.
Also write down the code that would be generated according to the
"Jumping Code" code-generation scheme. How many instructions do both
generated pieces of code execute in the case where "x==y" holds?  <a href="codegen/codegen-solution.pdf">solution</a></li>
