<h1>Week 10</h1>
<h1>Exercises on optimization</h1>
<ol>

<li>Consider the following two proposals for new peephole patterns.
Are they sound? How would those that are sound look as C-code?
Would they ever be relevant?
<p>
<ul>
<li>
Replace

<pre>
ldc_string "..."
dup
ifnull L
</pre>
by
<pre>
ldc_string "..."
</pre>
<p>
<li>Replace
<pre>
return
&lt;&lt;anything&gt;&gt;
</pre>
by
<pre>
return
</pre>
</ul>
<p>
<i>Motivation</i>: get you thinking about the upcoming peephole
contest deliverable.
<p>

<li>Study the contents of the WIG run-time libraries in
<a href="../wig/lib/"><code>wig/lib</code></a>.  How could you adapt
or port them for use by your own generated code?
<p>
<i>Motivation</i>: you may well want to implement such a library for
programs compiled by your own WIG compiler.
<p>

<li>Outline a strategy for WIG code generation.  What parts are
tricky?
<p>
<i>Motivation</i>: codegen is the final phase left for you to
implement in your WIG compiler.
<p>

<li>What kinds of optimizations might be relevant for WIG programs?  Why?
<p>
<i>Motivation</i>: domain-specific programming languages generally
present novel and interesting optimization opportunities.

<li>(Optional.) Study the code for optimizing JOOS programs.  What
parts are unclear?
<p>
<i>Motivation</i>: help prepare you for the upcoming peephole contest deliverable.
