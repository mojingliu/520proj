<h1>Week 3</h1>
<h1>Exercises on abstract syntax trees</h1>

Study the A- code for parsing JOOS programs and building and weeding
abstract syntax trees, specifically the files joos.l, joos.y, tree.c,
tree.h, weed.c, and weed.h.  Answer the following questions:

<ol>
<li>How could calloc() simplify the scanner?  Is there a good reason
not to use it?

<li>Why do we need the *noshortif productions (rules)?  Illustrate
with example input.

<li>Why do we need the *ne* productions?  What does "ne" stand for?

<li>What kinds of illegal input are weeded out?  For each kind of
illegal input, explain why the designers of the JOOS language made it
illegal.

<li>How could an LALR(1) parser could avoid building backwards lists?
Illustrate with an example from joos.y and tree.c.
</ol>
