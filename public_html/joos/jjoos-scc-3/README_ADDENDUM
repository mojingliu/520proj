UPGRADE OF THE JJOOS COMPILER

The JJOOS was upgraded to use the SableCC3.0 compiler generator during the summer of 
2003. The main change was in the JJOOS grammar which now has a set of rules which 
generate an Abstract Syntax Tree instead of a Concrete Syntax Tree which was the case 
with the previous version of SableCC. There were changes to other files as well and 
that has been reflected in the history at the top of each file. We now require only 
a single pass of the fixer. 

SableCC was updated to SableCC3.0 by Kevin Agbakpem at the University of Quebec at 
Montreal. 

Enjoy!
