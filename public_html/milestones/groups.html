<h1><img src="../images/wig32.gif"> milestone: Group Formation and
Project Preparation</h1>

This milestone is intended to prepare you for the JOOS compiler
enhancements and WIG compiler from-scratch implementation that you
will complete in this course.  The WIG project will be essentially the
same as in previous years, and you are encouraged to look over the
past pages linked to from the top of the home page.  The JOOS
deliverables will also be quite similar to previous years.  In the
future, the precise requirements for each milestone and deliverable
for this year will be updated at least one week in advance of their
due dates.<p>

For this milestone, first go through all the interview questions with
the other members of your group.  You do not have to share all of the
information you submitted individually if you do not want to.  Then
answer the following questions:
<ol>
<li> What do the members of your group have in common?  What are the
differences between members?  What are the strengths of each member?

<li> Which compiler compiler toolset do you think you will use?  Why?
There is no need to repeat the reasons to use C / Java discussed in
class.  Note that for the next milestone you will extend the Tiny
language using flex+bison, SableCC 3, and if you are feeling
adventurous whatever other alternative tool you wish to
use for your compiler instead.  This is to give you some experience
with all toolsets and let you change your mind before it is too late.

<li> What problems, if any, do you anticipate in the functioning of
your group?

<li> What are your plans for scheduling future group meetings?

<li> What are your plans for dividing the work?  What are the roles
for each member?  How will you ensure that every member knows how the
different parts of the compiler work?  Describe your software
development strategy.
</ol>

Answer these questions in a plain text ASCII file
called <tt>preparation.txt</tt>.  Please make sure that each line is
less than 80 characters wide.  Check it in to SVN
as <tt>group-X/reports/preparation.txt</tt>, where X is your group
number.

This milestone is due by midnight on Friday of week 3.  The grade will
be wrapped into the following week's milestone.  Marks will be generously
deducted for late submissions.
