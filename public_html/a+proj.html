<h1>The <img src="images/a+small.gif"> project</h1>

Michael and Laurie's original JOOS compiler is very nice indeed and
has received the excellent grade of A-.  However, there is room for
improvement, which could elevate their grade to an amazing A+.  This
project focuses on four such improvements.
<p><hr><p>

<h3>C-style comments</h3>
The A- implementation only allows one-line comments such as:
<font face=courier><pre>
// this is a comment
</pre></font>
It would also be nice to allow multi-line comments such as:
<font face=courier><pre>
/* this is a
   somewhat
   longer comment */
</pre></font>
This improvement can be implemented by only making changes to the 
file <a href="joos/a-/joos.l"><font face=courier><code>joos.l</code></font></a>.
<p><hr><p>

<h3>Increments and for-loops</h3>
It would be nice to include standard increments and for-loops such as:
<font face=courier><pre>
for (i=0; i<10; i++) k=k*i;
</pre></font>
These constructs may be introduced as mere syntactic sugar, since
they can readily be expressed in the JOOS language itself. 
This improvement can be implemented by only making changes to the 
files
<a href="joos/a-/joos.l"><font face=courier><code>joos.l</code></font></a> and
<a href="joos/a-/joos.y"><font face=courier><code>joos.y</code></font></a>.
<p><hr><p>

<h3>Correct stack limits</h3>
The weakest point of the A- implementation is the stupid computation of
stack limits, which are always assumed to equal 25. It would be much
nicer to compute the exact limit. This improvement can be implemented by only
making changes to the 
file <a href="joos/a-/emit.c"><font face=courier><code>emit.c</code></font></a>.
<p><hr><p>

<h3>More peephole patterns</h3> 
The peephole optimizer provides a nice framework, but the A-
implementation only includes four peephole patterns. Surely, many more
can be discovered.  This improvement can be implemented by only making
changes to the file <a href="joos/a-/patterns.h"><font
face=courier><code>optimize.c</code></font></a>.
