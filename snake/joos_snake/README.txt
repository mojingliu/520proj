We created a first-person interactive fiction game based on the timeless 
classic "SNAKE."  

To run, joosc IFSnakeGame.java SnakeHead.java SnakeBody.java Apple.java
Then java IFSnakeGame to play the game.

Once in game, you have 6 commands: forward, left, right, help, cheat and quit.

"forward" - move forward.
"left" - turn left.
"right" - turn right.
"help" - displays help.
"cheat" - toggles overhead display.
"quit" - quits the game to command line.

Use the directional commands to navigate the board, being careful not to eat
your own tail or crash into a wall during your quest to consume as many apples
as possible.  If you're terrible at games or not having enough fun, use "cheat"
to toggle the overhead display of the game board and allow yourself to play the
slowest possible version of an entirely reflex-based game.

The game ends when you type "quit" or you crash into a wall or 
your own tail.  Try to see how long you can make your body before you die or 
quit out of boredom!

If you ever get stuck, type help to see a list of commands.  But honestly,
if you can't remember three directions and "quit" you're probably not going to 
get very far regardless.
